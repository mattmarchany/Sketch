### Building

To build, be sure to have installed:
* Android Studio or Eclipse
* Java 1.6+
* Android SDK

I used Android Studio to build and deploy this project so your mileage with Eclipse may vary.

### Origins
I put this together for a friend who needed something really, really simple for some grade school students using Android tablets.

If you're a novice when it comes to Android/Java this might be a good project for you.

If you're comfortable with custom Views and using Android graphics libraries I suggest looking elsewhere for something more advanced!
